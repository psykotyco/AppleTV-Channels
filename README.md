AppleTV App to watch tv channels made in MVP

Oh my god, my TV antena is not working and I can watch the news in the morning with a coffee :(

This AppleTV (4ยบ generation) project, is a homebrew idea, it doesn't has commercial purposes or anything related.
Code has been build with MVP architecture and is open to add more channel datasources.

Improvements, design and icons are welcomed ^^
